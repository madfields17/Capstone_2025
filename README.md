### [`trisha-branch`](https://github.com/madfields17/Capstone_2025/tree/trisha-branch) â€“ by Trisha Sanghal
**Focus:** Fine-tuning the Res-TSSDNet model and building an interactive web application.  
- Performed exploratory data analysis across multiple datasets to guide informed dataset selection.  
- Trained, fine-tuned, and evaluated the **Res-TSSDNet** architecture for equitable audio deepfake detection.  
- Designed and built a web application to present project insights and demo the best-performing model: [Live Web App](https://capstone-web-app-six.vercel.app/).
